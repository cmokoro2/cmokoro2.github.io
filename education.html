      <h2>Challenges Faced by African Kids in Education</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>High Child Labor Rates:</strong> Over 20% of African children aged 6 to 17 are engaged in child labor, hindering their education and development.</li>
        <li><strong>Abject Poverty:</strong> Extreme poverty prevents many families from affording school fees, leading to numerous children being unable to attend school.</li>
        <li><strong>Inadequate Funding:</strong> Grassroots education systems lack sufficient funding, resulting in poor infrastructure, untrained staff, and insufficient educational resources.</li>
        <li><strong>High Numbers of Out-of-School Children:</strong> More than 42 million African children are not in school, with 60% unable to attend elementary school due to financial constraints.</li>
      </ul>
