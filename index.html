      <h2> What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        At African Kids Education Matters (AkEM), we aim to identify talented and gifted children in underprivileged African communities who lack access to quality education. Our mission is to provide these children with the support they need to reach their full potential. We believe that early identification and the right education, coupled with training in 21st-century skills, can prepare these gifted children to make a global impact and play a crucial role in reducing poverty and illiteracy in Africa.
      </p>
      <h2> How We Do It</h2>
      <p>
        We collaborate with schools in rural and suburban areas of selected communities to identify gifted children. Our support includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Educational Funding:</strong> We finance the construction and improvement of school infrastructure to create a conducive learning environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Scholarships:</strong> We offer scholarships to gifted children, covering their education up to the university level.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational Materials:</strong> We provide essential instructional materials and study aids to enhance teaching and learning effectiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>Education and Skills Training:</strong> We prioritize STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education, music, and entrepreneurship training. Recognizing that STEM careers are key to solving economic challenges in Africa, we focus particularly on empowering girls in STEM to promote gender equality. Additionally, we support children with talents in music and entrepreneurship, catering to their diverse interests and abilities.</li>
      </ul>

We also host community-based educational enlightenment campaigns where we expose children and their parents to things that could be achieved in the world through a good education.</p>
